# Question
Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.
# Example

## Example 1:

Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"\
Output: 4\
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

## Example 2:

Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"\
Output: 2\
Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.

## Example 3:

Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"\
Output: -1\
Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
 

## Constraints:

1 <= sentence.length <= 100\
1 <= searchWord.length <= 10\
sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.\
searchWord consists of lowercase English letters.
 

# My solution 
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPrefixOfWord(self, sentence, searchWord):
        """
        :type sentence: str
        :type searchWord: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        s = sentence.split()
        for ind, word in enumerate(s):
            if word[:len(searchWord)] == searchWord:
                return ind+1
        return -1
```
