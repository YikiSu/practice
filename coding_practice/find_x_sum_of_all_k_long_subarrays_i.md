# Question
You are given an array nums of n integers and two integers k and x.

The x-sum of an array is calculated by the following procedure:

- Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.
- Keep only the occurrences of the top x most frequent elements. If two elements have the same number of occurrences, the element with the bigger value is considered more frequent.
- Calculate the sum of the resulting array.

Note that if an array has less than x distinct elements, its x-sum is the sum of the array.

Return an integer array answer of length n - k + 1 where answer[i] is the x-sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].

 
# Example

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], k = 6, x = 2

Output: [6,10,12]

Explanation:

For subarray [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4], only elements 1 and 2 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2.\
For subarray [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], only elements 2 and 4 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[1] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4. Note that 4 is kept in the array since it is bigger than 3 and 1 which occur the same number of times.\
For subarray [2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3], only elements 2 and 3 are kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[2] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3.

## Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,8,7,8,7,5], k = 2, x = 2

Output: [11,15,15,15,12]

Explanation:

Since k == x, answer[i] is equal to the sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].

## Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 50\
1 <= nums[i] <= 50\
1 <= x <= k <= nums.length

        :type x: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ans = []
        n = len(nums)
        cnt = {}
        for ind in range(n-k+1):
            curr = 0
            if ind == 0:
                cnt = collections.Counter(nums[:k])
            else:
                cnt[nums[ind-1]] -= 1
                cnt[nums[ind+k-1]] += 1
            for num in sorted(cnt, key=lambda x:(cnt[x], x), reverse=True)[:x]:
                curr += num*cnt[num]
            ans.append(curr)
        return ans
```
