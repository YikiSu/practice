# Question
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.
# Example

## Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"

Output: "e"

Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

## Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"

Output: "y"
 

## Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000\
t.length == s.length + 1\
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

# My solution 
```python
import collections
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not s:
            return t
        s_cnt = collections.Counter([st for st in s])
        t_cnt = collections.Counter([st for st in t])
        for key in t_cnt.keys():
            if key not in s_cnt.keys() or t_cnt[key]>s_cnt[key]:
                return key
